#Development Guidelines:
  - Use PHP 8.4+ features where appropriate
  - Follow Laravel conventions and best practices (laravel 12 with react + pest 4)
  - Focus on creating code that provides excellent developer experience (DX), better autocompletion, type safety, and comprehensive docblocks

#Coding Standards and Conventions:
  - Class and Enum names: Use PascalCase (e.g., MyClass)
  - Method names: Use camelCase (e.g., myMethod)
  - Constants and Enum Cases names: Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MY_CONSTANT)
  - use events and listeners for business logic, create jobs for heavy tasks
  - we should try to keep code as independent parts so we can test it easily, like jobs, commands, events, listeners, services

# LOOK UP DATABASE RECORDS
if you need to find records in db: e.g. users id 1,2,3,4,5 run docker-compose exec laravel.test php artisan tinker --execute="print_r(DB::select('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)', [1,2,3,4,5]));"
if you want to see mysql structure of a table, you can run, e.g. show create table users: docker-compose exec  laravel.test php artisan tinker --execute="print_r(DB::select('SHOW CREATE TABLE users'));"
if you need to run any query to see records in db run: docker-compose exec  laravel.test php artisan tinker --execute="print_r(DB::select('Your query with param = ?', [1]));" - params are optional

we do not need to create markdown files like .md or text or other docs if i do not ask you directly to do so.(!!IMPORTANT!!)

run php artisan commands or create/run migrations using docker-compose exec laravel.test php artisan ...
You can run commands php artisan via docker-compose exec laravel.test php artisan ...

TESTS - if you changed code/tests you should run tests to make sure everything is ok.
tests can be executed by docker-compose exec laravel.test ./vendor/bin/pest

REBUILD CODE - if you need full rebuild npm + php clear cache + migrate + composer install
docker-compose exec laravel.test ./upd.sh

REBUILD NPM - if you change html/css/js/react files
docker-compose exec laravel.test npm install && npm run build

When you run laravel commands add to command -d max_execution_time=30

we have null coalescing operator in php 8.4+ and you can use it like this: $var ?? 'default value' or you can use $var?->method();

#BROWSER TESTING - use @Browser when you need to test page
APP_ENV in .env (NEVER USE http://localhost !!!) - https://laravel.test.marketking.orb.local this is host of local project so you can use this host for testing - it is pointed to local docker

When you write a prompt for ai store it in blade file in folder resources/views/ai-prompts

look at app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php to understand project better

use best practises of laravel and devops when you write code so it is easy to maintain and extend the code

do not create .md files unless i ask you to do so. (!!IMPORTANT!!)

all prompts should be stored resources/views/ai-prompts so we can render them via view('ai-prompts.name')->render();
